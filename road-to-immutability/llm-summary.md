# Road to Immutability — condensed summary for LLMs

Dense, load-bearing summary of `src/docs/asciidoc/` (the authoritative terminology source for maddi's
immutability/modification/linking vocabulary). Read this instead of the full book; open a specific
chapter only when detail is missing here.

## Core vocabulary

- **maddi** — static analyzer for Java (and Kotlin via a shared CST) that computes modification,
  independence and immutability properties.
- **Mutable** means "not immutable at any positive level"; `@Mutable` is the explicit bottom verdict.
- **Content** of an object = the objects reachable from its fields (the object graph), split into:
  - **accessible content** — reachable through fields/accessors the analyzer can see and name;
  - **hidden content** — content that exists but cannot be named structurally: type parameters,
    extensible (non-final) types, the elements of shallowly-analyzed containers. Leaf immutables
    (String, primitives, boxed) have NO hidden content; containers of immutables DO.
- **`@IgnoreModifications` = manual hidden content** (road §050 "Ignoring modifications as manual hidden
  content"): a field of concrete (mutable) type whose modifications the author disclaims. Same lattice effect
  as a type-parameter field (→ at best `@Immutable(hc=true)`, never hc-free); it differs only in *provenance* —
  erasure *derives* confinement, `@IgnoreModifications` *asserts* it, so soundness must be **checked** not
  assumed. **Confinement guard**: a modification reached through the field must stay in the *ignored stratum*
  (transitive content reachable only via that field). Writing into the stratum, and referencing accessible
  content from it, are confined and fine (this is why an analyzer filling an `@IgnoreModifications analysis()`
  overlay is legal); an *escape* into the type's own accessible content **caps immutability** (the separation
  check), an escape into global/static state is a **`@StaticSideEffects`** — does NOT cap (not your field) but
  flags a real outward effect. SSE is thus the global-escape arm of the same guard; `@IgnoreModifications` on
  the *target* global field downgrades an SSE to a sanctioned disclaimer (the `System.out` story).
- **Modification**: a method is *modifying* when it assigns, or modifies the content of, something in
  the object graph of its receiver's fields. Marked `@Modified` / `@NotModified`.
  - A *static* method mutating a parameter does not have a receiver to modify: the parameter is marked
    modified instead.
  - **All non-trivial constructors are modifying** (they assign fields).
  - Field property `unmodified` is **content-only**: it says the field's *content* is never modified;
    field *assignment* is tracked separately via effective finality (rule 0 below).
- **Independence** is a separate axis from immutability: it captures whether a method's return
  value/parameters expose (parts of) the receiver's content. `@Independent` (nothing shared),
  `@Independent(hc=true)` (only hidden content shared), dependent (mutable content shared).
- **Container** (`@Container`): a type whose methods do not modify their parameters.

## Immutability levels and rules

Levels (property `IMMUTABLE_TYPE`), ordered: `NO_VALUE(-1, undecided)` < `MUTABLE(0)` <
`FINAL_FIELDS(1)` < `IMMUTABLE_HC(2)` = `@Immutable(hc=true)` < `IMMUTABLE(3)` = `@Immutable`.

Rules (each level requires the previous):
- **Rule 0 (→ FINAL_FIELDS)**: all instance fields effectively final — never assigned outside the
  construction phase. "Construction phase" = constructors + methods only reachable from constructors
  (*part of construction*). Assignments to a nested type's fields by the ENCLOSING type, a sibling
  nested type, or a lambda anywhere in the primary type all count (whole-primary-type scan).
  A synthetic/annotated setter also breaks finality.
- **Rule 1 (→ level 2)**: no field's content is modified by the type's own methods.
- **Rule 2 (→ level 2)**: every field is private OR of (at least hc-)immutable type.
- **Level 2 vs 3 (hidden content)**: `@Immutable` (hc-free, level 3) additionally requires that every
  instance field's type is itself deeply immutable (level 3), the type is not extensible, and
  independence holds. A private, never-modified, never-exposed field of a mutable type is *hidden
  content*, not absence of content → level 2, not 3. Static fields do NOT count toward instance
  immutability (they belong to the class).
- Exposure matters: a type that stores externally supplied mutable objects (dependent constructor) or
  returns its mutable content (dependent accessor, e.g. record accessors) caps at FINAL_FIELDS.
- A mutable supertype makes the subtype mutable; an undecided supertype blocks the decision (see cycle
  breaking).

## Eventual immutability — COMPUTED

`@Mark`, `@Only(before/after)`, `@BeforeMark`, `@TestMark`, `@Immutable(after="...")` describe types
that transition once from mutable to immutable (builders, freeze patterns, `SetOnce`/`FirstThen`
support classes). The CURRENT engine reads them as contracts (`Value.Eventual`/`Value.EventuallyImmutable`;
properties `EVENTUAL_METHOD`, `EVENTUAL_PARAMETER`, `EVENTUALLY_IMMUTABLE_TYPE`,
`EVENTUALLY_FINAL_FIELD`) **and computes them**, in `TypeEventualAnalyzer` (phase 4.3), without
reviving preconditions: a type holding a field of eventually immutable type inherits the mark, because
the callee's own contract says which side of the transition it belongs to. Marks travel from an
implementation to its abstract method (`AbstractMethodAnalyzerImpl.methodEventual`), so interfaces are
certified too. `@TestMark` implies `@NotModified` — observing the state is not changing it.
Independence is relaxed after the mark only when the leaked object is ITSELF eventually immutable.
Mark labels are field *names* (a mark is often inherited). Eventuality is deliberately kept OUT of the
`IMMUTABLE_TYPE` lattice for now. `@BeforeMark` is not read yet. The analyzer's own code follows the
pattern heavily (builder-commit CST, write-once property maps).
Plan and staging: `docs/eventual-immutability.md`.

## The link system (chapter 105; module maddi-modification-link)

A **link** is `(from, nature, to)` between variables (incl. fields of variables, array elements,
synthetic variables). Purpose: the relational substrate from which modification/independence/
immutability verdicts are derived.

- **Natures** (notation used in engine output): `≡` identity; `←`/`→` assigned from/to; `∈`/`∋`
  element of / contains; `⊆`/`⊇` subset/superset; `~` shares elements; `≺`/`≻`/`≈` field-level;
  `≤`/`≥`/`∩` object-graph (weakest); `↗`/`↖` decoration (functional interfaces). Reciprocals appear
  in pairs. `*` after a variable = modified there. `0:`/`1:` = parameter index.
- **Two field models**: parsed types link to real fields (`box.t`); shallow/JDK types link to
  **virtual fields** `§xs`/`§es`/`§kvs` (= named hidden content). `§m` = the modification component
  ("the mutable aspect, wherever it lives").
- **Method link summary (mlv)**: per method — return links, per-parameter links, modified set; e.g. a
  setter: `[0:box*.t←1:x*] --> -  MOD[0:box,1:x]`. Applied at each call site by translating formal
  this/params to actual receiver/args (`LinkMethodCall` is the central class).
- **Functional interfaces**: capture site wraps a lambda/method-ref into a synthetic FI variable
  (`$_fi`, `Λ`) carrying its links; application site (`forEach`, `map`, SAM invocation) *lifts* those
  links onto the concrete receiver; unknown-lambda application is recorded as `$_afi` and resolved at
  the caller that supplies the lambda. Links to CAPTURED enclosing-method parameters pass through
  untranslated.
- **Closure**: links compose via a binary operator on natures (weakest results compose to nothing →
  finite). Incremental fixpoint engine: each derived fact carries a **witness** (its composing pair);
  removal invalidates exactly the dependent facts. Modification demotes containment: `⊇` → `~` at the
  modification statement, only for links the modified variable owns.
- **Shared-variable (sv) collapse** — fixes the part-of link explosion (locals × fields quadratic
  growth). Two equivalence tiers: *modification identity* (`≡` on `§m`) and *assignment groups*
  (whole-object assignment chains). The graph stores edges on group representatives; **reconstruction**
  projects facts back onto real params/fields/return at summary extraction, governed by assignment
  DIRECTION (source→recipient only), field-level mirroring, and a transitive-redundancy pass.
- Authoritative technical refs (in `maddi-modification-link/`): `linking-manual.md` (start at §5
  LinkMethodCall + §6 worked examples; TestLinkMethodCall is the spec-by-example), `README.md` (nature
  combination table), `vf/virtual-fields.md`, `sv-reconstruction-techniques.md`.

## Convergence — the iterating analyzer (chapter 108; module maddi-modification-analyzer)

- **Property discipline**: verdicts are property values on methods/fields/types (`element.analysis()`).
  Write-once; absence = undecided (first-class state, revisit later); the guarded `TolerantWrite`
  allows only monotone refinement (used by cycle breaking).
- **Ordering**: analysis order from call graph + hierarchy; *part of construction* computed per type;
  shallow summaries / annotated APIs for non-source types.
- **Iteration**: passes over the analysis order counting property changes; after the first pass a
  **worklist** narrows to dirty elements (mapped to their enclosing analysis-order element). Optional
  parallel execution (min(8, cores−2) threads); known non-confluent residue: constructor modification
  verdicts can flip with scheduling (conservative side is correct); tracked, not hidden.
- **Certification**: after quiescence, verification passes recompute everything frozen and require
  zero changes → the published fixpoint is path-independent. The proving ground (timefold, langchain4j,
  fernflower, guava, activemq, jenkins-core, camel-core modules) is kept certified & crash-free.
- **Cycle breaking**: at the certification point, if immutability-undecided types remain, one more full
  pass runs with undecided inputs resolved by strategy (undecided supertype floored at FINAL_FIELDS;
  no-information treated as non-modifying), then re-certifies. Conclusions that rest on broken cycles
  are capped at hc-level (2), never granted hc-free (3). Since 2026-07-19 the breaking pass also
  resolves the field/abstract-method path: a verdict that will never arrive (a field's unmodified
  status, a NON-PRIVATE field's type immutability, an abstract method's modification — each rooted in
  external unannotated types, and transitively CASCADING through field types) is pessimistic, and the
  type concludes FINAL_FIELDS instead of staying undecided. This eliminated the "type-null clusters"
  (51% of elasticsearch's 45k types; 100% coverage on guava after).
- **Analysis hints** (annotated APIs): curated JDK properties (String=@Immutable, Object=@ImmutableHC,
  collections mutable, functional interfaces with link summaries), loaded AFTER parse via
  `--preload-analysis-results-dirs`, pre-seeding the property store. Without them the positive
  immutability side barely concludes.
- **Fault tolerance**: statement/method-level containment (degrade to shallow summary), tight-ceiling
  cycle protection (throw + shallow fallback; generous ceilings cause downstream grind), producer-side
  skip guards for unrepresentable link shapes (e.g. stacked `x.§m.§m` faces).
- **Env gates** (opt-outs/diagnostics): `NOWORKLIST`, `PARALLEL`, `NOCYCLEBREAKING`, `FPDUMP=<file>`
  (per-element verdict dump), `MLTRACE`, many link-module gates (read once via `Gate`).
- **Golden rule**: engine/performance changes are accepted only with a byte-identical FPDUMP A/B
  (modulo the documented constructor non-confluence). Speed never buys verdict changes.

## Engine facts an LLM should not re-derive wrongly

- Compare `TypeInfo`/`MethodInfo`/`FieldInfo` with `==` (single instance per FQN + source set).
- `unmodifiedField` is content-only by design; do not "fix" it to include assignment.
- **Chapter 14 "Other annotations" is mostly aspirational — do not assume those annotations work.**
  Only `@Identity`/`@Fluent` are computed (`TypeModIndyAnalyzerImpl`). `@NotNull`/`@Nullable`,
  `@UtilityClass` and `@Finalizer` are read as *contracts* by `AnnotationToProperty` (and shown by
  `DecoratorImpl`) but never inferred, and `@Finalizer`'s rules are not enforced. `@Singleton` and
  `@ExtensionClass` exist in `maddi-support` but have no property and are read by nothing. The
  chapter carries per-section "Not implemented" markers as of 2026-07-22.
- Record accessors expose components → records of mutable types are at best FINAL_FIELDS (dependent),
  or IMMUTABLE_HC when unexposed; never hc-free @Immutable.
- Interfaces: extensible ⇒ hidden content ⇒ at best `@Immutable(hc=true)`; a constants-only interface
  deserves immutability (no instance fields).
- Stateless lambdas/anonymous classes currently stay at FINAL_FIELDS (known conservative gap).
- **When immutability is the focus, analyze as many dependencies as SOURCE as possible, not as jars.**
  A type read shallowly (a compiled jar without an annotated API) gets conservative modification
  verdicts: an unannotated read accessor never establishes `@NotModified`, so a field read *directly*
  through it (`this.store.getOrDefault(...)`) is conservatively `@Modified`, which caps the enclosing
  type's immutability. The shallow/annotated-API path under-approximates the immutable side; source does
  not. (Concretely: `ParameterInfoImpl.analysis` was capped only because `PropertyValueMap.getOrDefault`
  lived in a jar — see `docs/eventual-info-hierarchy.md`.)
- javac is not thread-safe: all JavacTask access must be single-threaded
  (`-XDuseUnsharedTable=true`, synchronized lazy `getOrLoad`).
